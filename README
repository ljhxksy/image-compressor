## Acknowledgements
We would like to thank all the TAs for their help and guidance during Office 
Hours through the process of completing this assignment, especially Dan and 
Marten (SAVED OUR LIVES), Bill (we love bill <3), Tim (for telling us to delete 
the 4 gigantic mobo files), Trevor, Alex, Rohun, Neil (we love your flowers 
sweater), and Charlie. 

We also used Piazza and Stack Overflow to help debug our program. Also, we 
utilized Hanson's C Interfaces and Implementations. 

## Architecture Explanation

40image.c - Given main for processing input file

bitpack.c & bitpack.h - Contains the implementation of functions for 
                        manipulating bit-packed data.

codeword.c & codeword.h - Contains the implementation of functions for 
                          packing components of a Compressed struct into a 
                          codeword and unpacking a codeword into the 
                          Compressed struct

compVidConversion.c & compVidConversion.h - Contains the implementation of
                                            functions for converting component
                                            videos

compress40.c - Contains functions for compressing and decompressing PPM images
               given from the input file

helper.c - Contains the declaration of helper functions and structs 
           that are used across the compression and decompression of ppm images

rgbConversion.c - contains the implementation of functions for converting RGB


## Implementation Description
We were able to follow all specifications and construct a functioning program 
to the best of our knowledge.


## Approximate Time Spent Analyzing Problems in Assignment
We spent approximately 10 hours analyzing the problems in the assignment.


## Approximate Time Spent Solving Problems after Analysis
We spent approximately 40 + 5 hours solving the problems in the assignment 
after (yay cs40 + 5)
